FAQ

Q: How can I use the website?

A: If opening the code in IE doesn;t work go to about:blank , this is an blank page, do ctrl+shift+i or F12 and right click the upper most element and click edit as html.
Than delete <html><head></head><body></body></html> and copy paste all the code into there. Than close the developer tools and there we go!
We will create an website for this sooner or later but this is just temorairly.
